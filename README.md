# easyeffects-presets
Collection of easyeffects presets that I make and use on my devices
All of these are created based on my taste and opinion.
Sound signatures are designed to brighten the treble and boost the bass, to keep balance but enjoy those deep basses.
|Name|Description|Use case|
|-|-|-|
|ejaz-mud-redesigned (Mud Redesigned)|Extremely heavy bass, a nice shaped mid-range, crisp treble and little to no compressor interference. You might experience clipping, as the compressor isn't saving you, but actively making things worse. (note: Based on a previous profile I made to reverse Dell's attempt to force users to use MaxxAudio (which isn't available on Linux))|Speakers + subwoofers|
|ejaz-headmounted|A lighter version of Mud Redesigned, but with a downwards compressor suppressing lower frequencies to prevent clipping and other side effects.|Over-ear headphones (recommended), IEMs|
